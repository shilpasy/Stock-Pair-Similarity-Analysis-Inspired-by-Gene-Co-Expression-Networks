# Stock-Pair-Similarity-Analysis-Inspired-by-Gene-Co-Expression-Networks
 This project identifies and analyzes the most closely correlated stock pairs in the NASDAQ-100, using daily return data over the past 3 years. The goal is to discover which stocks move together most tightly — both in direction and in magnitude — similar to how gene co-expression networks reveal biologically linked genes.
